# RsBaM Vertretungsplan Project for Schools

Welcome to the RsBaM Vertretungsplan Project! This project was specifically designed for schools to provide an easier way for teachers to access and view the "Vertretungsplan".

## What is a Vertretungsplan?

A "Vertretungsplan" is a German term that refers to a substitution plan or schedule. Schools use it to notify teachers and students about changes in their regular schedule due to absent teachers or other unforeseen events. It helps ensure that the educational process is not disrupted, and everyone is informed about who will be taking over a particular class or if there are any room changes.

## Features

1. **PostgreSQL Database Connection**: All the data regarding the Vertretungsplan is stored in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring smooth data transactions and management using SQLAlchemy.
2. **Vertretungsplan Endpoints**: Simple endpoints that teachers can access to retrieve the latest Vertretungsplan updates and changes.
3. **Authorization Checks**: To make sure only the school's staff can access the data, we have set up authorization checks that rely on authentication tokens.

## Getting Started

(Add here the steps on how to access the system, whether it's a web portal or an app. Instructions about logging in, navigating the interface, etc.)

## API Endpoints

Thank you for using the RsBaM Vertretungsplan Project. Our main goal is to ensure that the school's teaching process remains efficient and any changes in the schedule are communicated seamlessly to all concerned parties.
